<b>Title:</b> Applications of blowup algebras
<br>
<br>
<b>Abstract:</b> In this talk, we will define what is a blow up algebra.
We will see all kind of applications of blow up algebras including
chemical reaction network, geometry modeling, and permutation
statistics. We will see that this topic has many wide open questions.

	<b>Title:</b> Trace maps and trace modules over commutative rings
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Abstract:</b> The well-known trace map on matrices can be
	generalized to a map on any module over a commutative ring. The
	image of such a map is a trace module. In this talk, I will discuss
	some historical uses for and recent developments in the theory of
	trace modules over commutative Noetherian rings. This will include
	applications of trace modules in understanding free summands,
	endomorphism rings, and special classes of rings.	<br>

	<b>Title:</b> Rings of characteristic \(p>0\), the Frobenius functor, and test ideals
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Abstract:</b> he study of commutative rings of characteristic
	\(p>0\) has played a major role in the study of singularities of
	commutative rings in all characteristics. The main tool used to
	study these rings is the Frobenius functor, which acts on ring
	elements by \(r \mapsto r^p\). We will discuss the action of the
	Frobenius functor on modules over commutative rings and use this to
	explore the test ideal, a tool for classifying singularities of
	commutative rings in characteristic \(p>0\).	<br>

	<b>Title:</b> Hilbert functions in algebra and geometry
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Abstract:</b> In a famous 1890 paper, David Hilbert shook the
	world of algebra by proving that for any graded module over a
	polynomial ring the vector space dimensions of its graded components
	are eventually given by a polynomial function. The function that
	records these dimensions is nowadays known as the Hilbert function
	in his honor. 
<br><br>
In this talk, we will explore the properties of Hilbert functions and
discuss some open problems concerning them that have puzzled algebraists
for a while. Many questions on Hilbert functions can be reduced to the
zero-dimensional case, that is, to investigating the  Hilbert functions
of a finite set of points in projective space. This will lead us towards
some fruitful connections to geometry.	<br>

	<b>Title:</b> Projections of the Veronese Variety
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Abstract:</b> The degree \(\delta\) Veronese variety is the image of the map \(v_{\delta}: \mathbb{P}^{d-1} \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^{n-1}\) which sends \([x_1: \cdots : x_d]\) to all monomials of total degree \(\delta\). 
Let \(R=k[x_1, \ldots, x_d]\) and let \(I\) be the \(R\)-ideal generated be all monomials of total degree \(\delta\).
We are interested in computing the coordinate ring of the image of \(v_{\delta}\), also known as the special fiber ring of \(I\).
In this talk we will discuss a classical computation for this coordinate ring in the \(delta=2\) case.
We will then discuss how to compute the coordinate ring of a projection of the degree 2 Veronese variety from a general point.	<br>

	<b>Title:</b> Local Cohomology Modules
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Abstract:</b> The local cohomology modules associated to a ring are an indexed
sequence of objects that give information, such as the dimension and the
depth of the ring. However, they are also fascinating modules with rich
structures in their own right. In this talk, we will commute several
examples, some straightforward and some bizarre.	<br>

	<b>Title:</b> Quantitative Properties of Ideals arising from Hierarchical Models
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Abstract:</b> We will discuss hierarchical models and certain toric
ideals as a way of studying these objects in algebraic statistics. Some
algebraic properties of these ideals will be described and a formula for
the Krull dimension of the corresponding toric rings will be presented. 
One goal is to study the invariance properties of families of ideals
arising from hierarchical models with varying parameters. We will
present classes of examples where we have information about an
equivariant Hilbert series. This is joint work with Uwe Nagel. 	<br>

	<b>Title:</b> Properties of Binomial Edge Ideals
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Abstract:</b> Binomial edge ideals are ideals that are attached
	to a simple graph, and they are a generalization of the ideal of
	2-minors of a (2 x n)-matrix of indeterminates. After a review of
	free resolutions, I will show how the homological properties of
	binomial edge ideals relate to combinatorial invariants of the
	corresponding graph. Time permitting, I will also discuss what is
	known and some open questions in the special case of binomial edge
	ideals that come from closed graphs, which are equivalent to having
	a quadratic Gr√∂bner basis with respect to lex order.
