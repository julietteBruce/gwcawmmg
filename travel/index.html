	<li><b>Air Travel:</b> The Minneapolis â€“ Saint Paul International
	Airport (MSP) is located roughly ten miles from the University of
	Minnesota campus. One of the easiest ways to reach campus from the
	airport is via the light rail and bus system which costs roughly $3 (one way) and normally only takes 60 minutes. You can create a presonalized transit route
	via the <a href="https://www.metrotransit.org">MetroTransit</a> website.
	<br>
	<br>
	Another way to get to campus from the airport is via a taxi. A
	one-way trip between the aiport and campus costs roughly $50. One
	should plan on the trip being 25-45 minutes depending on traffic.
