There will be a limited amount of funding for junior participants. We
expect to be able to provide partial travel support for some
participants from within the United States. Accommodation for funded
participants will be arranged by the organizers for the nights of
Friday, April 12 and Saturday, April 13.
<br><br>
Researchers from generally underrepresented groups are strongly encouraged to
apply, and will be given priority when it comes to funding decisions.
<br><br>
We wish to make this conference as inclusive and welcoming as possible. If there is anything the organizers can
do in this direction to make attending the conference easier or more pleasent please contact us. 
In particular, if you are in need of child care during the conference,
please contact one of the organizers and we will help with arrangements.
