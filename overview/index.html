<i>Graduate Workshop in Commutative Algebra for Women & Mathematicians
of Other Minority Genders</i> is a workshop for early career researchers
(undergraduates, graduate students, post docs, etc.) being held at the
University of Minnesota, April 13-14, 2019. This workshop will focus on forming a community
of women and non-binary researchers interested in commutative algebra
through learning about specific topics in commutative algebra from a
diverse group of prominent active researchers: Kuei-Nuan Lin, Haydee M. A. Lindo, and Rebecca R.G., Alexandra Seceleanu. 
The workshop will be
particularly aimed at younger graduate students who are still in the
process of choosing a research area.

<br><br>
The goals of this workshop are:
<ul>
<li> Introduce participants to cutting edge research topics, and senior
researchers, in commutative algebra and related fields.</li>
<li> Facilitate the formation of mentoring relationships between participants and faculty
in commutative algebra.</li>
<li> Strengthen the network mathematicians from generally underrepresented groups, in particular women and non-binary researchers, in
commutative algebra and the surrounding areas.</li>
<li> Develop collaborative relationships that cut across standard
topic-collaborations and involve diverse groups of researchers.</li>
</ul>
Towards these goals the workshop will consist of four plenary lectures,
four twenty minute talks by senior grad students, a poster session,
small group discussions, and problem sessions.
<br><br>
Each plenary lecture will be a one hour talk by a preeminent researcher
in commutative algebra.These talks should accessible to a wide audience
and practice exercises related to the topic will be provided.
Additionally, there will be multiple venues for early career
participants to present their own research via invited twenty minute
talks and a poster session. In doing this we hope to promote a sense of
community amongst the participants, and open the door for collaborative
conversations. Finally, the workshop will also have dedicated time for
small group discussions. These discussions will give the early career
researchers a more informal chance to talk to the speakers, who are
experts in the area.
